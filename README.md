# Atsevofni

Atsevofni is not a real name, it is an alias for a fintech company operating in Indonesia, their real company name is confuscated for privacy purposes. They got me a challenge to build a dashboard presenting stock prices, using whatever stacks I am comfortable with.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as below:

- `apps/server`: Contains the backend application for the project, built using FastAPI.
- `apps/web`: Contains the frontend Vite + React application for the project.
