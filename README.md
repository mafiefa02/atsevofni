# Atsevofni

Atsevofni is not a real name, it is an alias for a fintech company operating in Indonesia, their real company name is confuscated for privacy purposes. They gave me a challenge to build a dashboard presenting stock prices, using whatever stacks I am comfortable with.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as below:

- `apps/server`: Contains the backend application for the project, built using FastAPI.
- `apps/web`: Contains the frontend Vite + React application for the project.

## Quickstart
1. Clone this repository and open the directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mafiefa02/atsevofni && cd atsevofni
   ```
2. Install the application's dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install:app
   ```
3. Run the local dev server!
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:5173]() to interact with the frontend, while the backend service can be accessed in [http://localhost:8000]().
